# 5-stage-pipelined-mips
This is a classic 5-stage pipeline mips 32-bit processor, including Fetch, Decode, Execute, Mem AND Writeback.


In this project, verilator is used to compile and simulate. Verilator is a software tool which synthesizes Verilog to a cycle-accurate behavioral model in C++ or system c.


The MIPS processor is coded based on the work of Dan Snyder and Yuan Zeng.
